# Contribution Guide <!-- omit in toc -->

Thank you for considering investing your time in contributing to the project! We wish to keep the community approachable and respectable.

This guide provides an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## Contributions

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss any changes you wish to make via an issue or wiki discussion with the owners of this repository before making a change.

To make sure you understand the general project concepts, please read the project [README](README.md).

## Creating a new issue

If you spot a problem with anything with the docs or with the model itself, [search the existing issues](https://github.com/hqdmTop/hqdmOntology/issues). If a related issue doesn't exist, open a [new issue](https://github.com/hqdmTop/hqdmOntology/issues/new/choose).

## Searching Issues

Scan through [existing issues](https://github.com/hqdmTop/hqdmOntology/issues) to find issues of interest to you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. If you find an issue to work on, please start a discussion to make sure the scope is clear and once you start development assign yourself to the issue. Once happy, open a PR with a fix or enhancement.

## Issue Workflow

- Choose an issue you wish to resolve. Where possible a pull request should correlate to a single issue.
- Assign yourself to the issue
- Fork the repository to your account.
- Commit your changes with a suitable commit message.
- Create/update any tests as appropriate.
- Update any documentation in the repository.
- Create a pull request to merge your branch from your fork into the repo's main branch, linking issues that will be resolved by merging this branch. _Draft pull requests can be used if you'd like early feedback on a particular aspect._
- The pull request will be reviewed by the core team to check for good practice such as usability and code styling. Following any changes and approval, your branch will be merged into main.
- Delete the branch.
- Close the issue.
- Enhancement made. Congratulations!
